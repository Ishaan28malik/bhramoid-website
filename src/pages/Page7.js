            <p>
              BrahMoID operates on transparent, ethical funding models. We do not accept donations 
              from corporations seeking political favors, nor do we engage in quid-pro-quo 
              arrangements. Our funding comes from legitimate sources committed to democratic 
              governance and transparency.

            <p>
              Political leaders and organizations subscribe to BrahMoID's services at fair, 
              transparent rates. This subscription model ensures that our platform remains 
              accessible while maintaining financial sustainability without compromising our 
              independence or neutrality.

            <p>
              We accept grants from foundations and organizations committed to democratic 
              governance, transparency, and citizen engagement. All grants are publicly disclosed, 
              and we maintain strict policies to ensure that funding sources do not influence 
              our platform's neutrality or functionality.

              BrahMoID does not accept contributions from corporations in exchange for political 
              influence or favors. We maintain strict separation between our funding sources and 
              the political leaders who use our platform, ensuring that our governance tools 
              remain free from corporate capture.

          <h2>Clean Money, Clean Governance</h2>
          <p>
            Political power should be built on transparency, accountability, and citizen trust—not 
            on opaque financial arrangements or corporate influence. BrahMoID demonstrates that 
            effective governance technology can be funded ethically and operate independently, 
            serving democracy rather than special interests.
