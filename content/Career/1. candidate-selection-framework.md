## Two Leadership Growth Pathways

---

### ✔ Pathway A — Party-Aligned Candidate

If aligned with a party, the party may provide:

- Campaign support  
- Manpower and logistics  
- Grassroots presence  
- Funding (at party discretion)  
- Mentorship and symbol  

BrahMoID remains politically neutral.

Candidates still operate within:

- BrahMoID identity system  
- Transparency commitments  
- Performance ledger  
- Public grievance engagement  

📌 Party supplies field strength.  
📌 BrahMoID supplies credibility and accountability.

---

### ✔ Pathway B — Independent / Self-Sponsored Candidate

Candidates choosing independence may access:

- Digital public profile  
- Trust and legitimacy tools  
- Online-first campaigning infrastructure  
- Citizen feedback systems  
- Volunteer mobilisation features  

📌 BrahMoID enables competitiveness without money or patronage networks.  
📌 BrahMoID does **not** finance campaigns.

---

## 3️⃣ Mutual Selection (Two-Way Choice)

The process is voluntary and mutual.

✔ Parties choose candidates aligned with their needs  
✔ Candidates choose parties aligned with their values  

This encourages trust-based partnerships instead of ticket-brokerage culture.

---

## 4️⃣ Party Support & Mentorship

Selected candidates may receive:

- Political mentorship  
- Campaign orientation  
- Field training  
- Volunteer mobilisation  
- Limited campaign assistance  
- Ethical and compliance awareness  

📌 Campaign support remains the party’s independent decision.  
📌 BrahMoID does not fund campaigns.

- Mukhiya / Sarpanch
