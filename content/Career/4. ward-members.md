# Volunteer Participation for Ward Members

Ward Members are the closest link between citizens and the Panchayat system.  
They often hear concerns first, understand local needs best, and quietly help resolve issues that may go unnoticed.

BrahMoID is designed to **support** Ward Members in this role — not replace, judge, or politicise them.

# What BrahMoID Does NOT Do

To maintain fairness and trust:

❌ Does not charge citizens for rights or entitlements  
❌ Does not influence elections or political outcomes  
❌ Does not replace government authority
