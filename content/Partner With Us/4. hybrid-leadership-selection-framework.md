# Hybrid Leadership Selection Framework

---

## Merit–Quota Candidate Selection Model (Proposed Framework)

BrahMoID recommends that partner political organisations allocate a small portion of candidate seats to leaders shortlisted through the BrahMoID merit-based leadership pipeline.

**Suggested range:**  
10% (starting point) → scalable up to 25% over time.

This creates a balanced leadership ecosystem where:

### Merit-Selected Candidates Contribute

- Public trust  
- Governance credibility  
- Integrity and competence  

### Party-Nominated Candidates Contribute

- Financial resources  
- Local networks  
- Organisational influence  

Together, this balance strengthens both:

- Electoral viability  
- Public legitimacy

## Strategic Rationale — How Parties Benefit

BrahMoID does not replace existing systems.  
It complements and strengthens them.

### Merit Candidates = Trust Capital

- Transparent selection  
- Governance-ready mindset  
- Appeal among youth and educated voters  
- Long-term credibility  

### Traditional Candidates = Resource Capital

- Campaign financing capacity  
- Mobilisation strength  
- Legacy networks and loyalty  

### Combined Advantage

This hybrid model helps parties:

- Reduce reliance on money power  
- Gradually introduce merit into politics  
- Test new leaders in low-risk constituencies  
- Build a next-generation leadership bench

## How the 10–25% Seat Allocation Works

| Stage | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Phase 1 (Pilot) | ~10% seats via BrahMoID merit pipeline in selected panchayats or wards |
| Phase 2 (Expansion) | 15–20% seats in the next election cycle |
| Phase 3 (Mature Model) | 25%+ merit-driven seats over time |

Growth is performance-led, not mandated.

Political parties retain full discretion.  
BrahMoID recommends and enables — final decisions remain with the party.
