## Transparent Funding Principles

BrahMoID follows clear and ethical funding practices.

We do not:

- Engage in quid-pro-quo arrangements  
- Allow funding sources to influence governance tools  

Our funding comes from sources aligned with democratic values and transparency.

Political leaders and organisations pay for access to governance tools and services.

This model ensures:

- Platform accessibility  
- Independence from political influence  
- Neutrality in operations

## Grants and Philanthropic Support

BrahMoID accepts grants from foundations and organisations that support:

- Democratic governance  
- Transparency  
- Citizen engagement  

### Safeguards

- All grants are publicly disclosed  
- Strict neutrality policies are maintained  
- Funding does not affect platform functionality or decisions

## No Corporate Political Contributions

BrahMoID does not accept corporate contributions tied to political influence or favors.

We maintain a strict separation between:

- Funding sources  
- Political leaders using the platform  

This ensures governance tools remain independent and free from corporate capture.

## Clean Money, Clean Governance

BrahMoID believes political credibility must be built on:

- Transparency  
- Accountability  
- Citizen trust  

—not opaque funding or influence-driven arrangements.

We aim to show that governance technology can be funded ethically while serving democratic systems rather than special interests.
