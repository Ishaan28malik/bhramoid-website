# BrahMoID–Party Operating Model

BrahMoID and political parties play complementary roles in modern governance.

BrahMoID provides the governance infrastructure.  
Political parties provide leadership, ideology, and political direction.

## What the Political Party Leads

While BrahMoID handles governance systems, the political party focuses on leadership, ideology, narrative, and expansion.

---

## 1. Define Ideology & Vision

BrahMoID does not define ideology.

The party determines:

- Core values and beliefs  
- Social philosophy  
- Economic stance  
- Long-term political vision  

BrahMoID is the vehicle.  
The party decides the direction.

## 2. Build Party Organization

The party manages:

- Leadership structures  
- Mandal/block-level committees  
- Booth-level teams  
- Membership drives  
- Worker training  
- Cadre expansion  
- Resource mobilisation  

BrahMoID supports organisation digitally but does not replace it.

## 3. Select & Develop Leaders

BrahMoID can support leadership evaluation using:

- Merit-based assessments  
- Performance rankings  
- Ethical compliance tracking  
- Citizen satisfaction indicators  

Final decisions remain with the party:

- Candidate selection

BrahMoID provides data.  
The party makes political decisions.

## 4. Public Relations & Campaigning

BrahMoID showcases governance performance.

The party handles:

- Campaign rallies  
- Public speeches  
- Voter mobilisation  
- Influencer outreach  
- Press interactions  
- Ideological branding  
- Election strategy  

BrahMoID is the proof.

## 5. Policy-Making & Legislative Action

After electoral success:

- MLAs propose state policies  
- MPs raise national issues  
- Parties draft manifestos  
- Parties lead legislative debates  

BrahMoID supports governance execution, but policy direction comes from the party.

---

## 6. Alliances & Political Relationships

Only the party handles:

- Coalition building  
- Inter-party relationships  
- Community engagement  
- Social organization partnerships  
- Local political dynamics  

BrahMoID remains politically neutral.  
The party leads diplomacy and alliances.
