# Women Representation Policy  
### (Merit-First, Rule-Based)

BrahMoID recognises that women constitute nearly half of the grassroots electorate and play a decisive role in governance outcomes.

To ensure fair representation without compromising merit, BrahMoID applies a structured, transparent inclusion mechanism within its candidate selection framework.

---

## Core Principle

**Reservation guarantees inclusion. Merit determines priority.**

Women candidates are not selected *because* they are women.  
They are selected through the same examination, evaluation, and performance standards applied to all candidates.

# How Women Representation Works in the BrahMoID Framework

---

## 1️⃣ Minimum Representation Threshold

- At least **30% of shortlisted candidates** should be women in each selection cycle  
- This is a **minimum threshold, not a fixed quota**  
- Applied only **after merit-based exam results are generated**

---

## 2️⃣ Merit Takes Absolute Priority

If women candidates naturally rank higher in the merit list:

- They are prioritised without restriction  
- No upper cap is imposed on selection  

### Example

If 8 out of the top 10 candidates are women:  
→ All 8 are shortlisted.

Performance alone determines ranking.

---

## 3️⃣ Structured Adjustment  
*(Only if representation falls below minimum)*

If fewer than 30% women appear in the initial shortlist:

- The highest-ranking women candidates are included  
- Adjustments occur only at the lower end of the list  

### This process is:

- Rule-based  
- Predictable  
- Transparent  
- Non-discretionary  

📌 No interviews, negotiations, or subjective overrides are used to enforce representation.

---

## 4️⃣ Equal Evaluation, Same Standards

Women candidates:

- Take the same written examinations  
- Undergo the same interviews or viva evaluations  
- Are assessed on identical leadership and ethics criteria  
- Enter the same party-aligned or independent pathways  

### No Special Tracks

- No relaxed cut-offs  
- No parallel pipelines  
- No symbolic nominations  

All candidates compete under the same standards.
