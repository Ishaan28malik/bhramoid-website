## Performance Ranking Based on Real-World Leadership Indicators

Every leader’s work is continuously evaluated through a transparent, community-driven, and data-powered scoring system.

### Ranking Criteria

- Bold and ethical decision-making*  
- Overall citizen satisfaction  
- Compliance with BrahMoID transparency and accountability standards  
- Delivery efficiency and issue-resolution success rate  

\* **Fairness Safeguard:**  
Individuals or groups directly affected by a decision may be selectively excluded from voting on this criterion to avoid conflicts of interest (e.g., disputed land matters or actions against local power groups).
