# BrahMoID vs IPAC

## Two Very Different Roles in Democracy

IPAC and BrahMoID both operate in the political space, but they serve very different purposes.

## What IPAC Does

IPAC is a political consulting company that helps political leaders and parties:

- Plan election campaigns  
- Understand voter sentiment  
- Shape messaging and strategy  
- Organize workers and volunteers  

IPAC typically works during election cycles or when a party wants to improve its electoral performance.

**Simply put:**  
IPAC helps politicians win elections.

## What BrahMoID Does

BrahMoID is a public accountability and governance platform.

It enables:

- Citizens to raise complaints openly  
- Government departments to respond publicly  
- Officials to showcase completed work  
- Public visibility on responses and delays  

BrahMoID operates continuously — not just during elections.
